# Thesis
Supervised Medical Image registration


## Description
This thesis contains code for training and testing a model called "Net" for a supervised medical image registration. The model is implemented as a subclass of nn.Module in PyTorch, and it is designed for undergrade thesis. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image registration tasks and includes functionality for data manipulation and evaluation.

##Prerequisites
    1. Python (version >= 3.7)
    2. PyTorch (version >= 1.13 )
    3. Use jupyter notebook or google colab

## Results
During training and testing, the model achieved the following average metrics:

Average Loss: 0.1767	
Average Mask accuracy: 95.05%	 
Average Jaccard: 0.9548	 
Average MI: 0.8895
